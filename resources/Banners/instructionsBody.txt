Objective:
---------
The objective of Mythic Quest is to defeat the enemies of humanity, namely the COVID boss and the viral monster minions.

Your ultimate goal, dear Hero, is to find the COVID boss, do battle, and rid the land of the deadly scourge by defeating the COVID boss.


Game play:
---------
You, as the player Hero-Warrior, will move around the map, battle enemies as you must, and collect items to build your health, attack, and defense.

Along the way, you may meet other people, have a chance to help them in their battles with COVID (or not - as you choose), and explore.


Commands:
--------
This is a turn-based game.  So you will type your commands to interact with the Mythic Quest game world and direct your character's action.

This is typically done with 2 words, such as a verb (an action word) AND a noun (a person/place/thing).

- To move west, you might type "go" and "west" so:  Go west.
- To pick up a helmet and add it to your inventory, you might type "get" and "helmet", so:  Get helmet.
- To use an item in your inventory, you might try:  Eat carrot, wear leggings, etc.

For example:
  > Eat carrot
  > Wear helmet
  > Run away
  > Attack monster
  Etc

- To get help at any time, type:  Help
- To exit the game at any time, type:  Quit


How to win or lose:
------------------
Win:  Keep your character alive until the bitter end AND find the COVID boss, reigning defeat on this master-mind force of darkness.

Lose:  Die.  The Game ends when your character dies (so sad, but play again!).


>> Final thoughts:
-----------------
- Observe your surroundings (look around) in each scene / location.
- Be sure to collect helpful items, such as foods, armor, parchments, and other items.
- Items will help you overcome challenges along the way and may be useful to defeat the COVID boss.
- Your game will autosave with each turn, BUT it is recommended for you to save at key points to return to.
