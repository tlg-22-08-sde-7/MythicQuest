The buildings were all beautifully crafted with intricate details and vibrant colors. The smell of freshly baked croissants and coffee filled the air, and the sound of cheerful chatter and laughter filled the streets.\n\nI walked past a bakery with a sign that read \"Boulangerie\" in beautiful cursive letters, and couldn't resist stopping to take a look inside. The interior was just as charming as the outside, with shelves lined with freshly baked goods and a glass case filled with delicious looking pastries.\n\nI continued walking down the narrow streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the town. I passed by a small outdoor caf√© where patrons were enjoying their meals and sipping on glasses of wine.
